Alpha 5.6
=============================
- Recoded TNE for stability reasons
  - TNE now uses a module-based system to give server owners even more control
  - This new system allows third-party developers to extend TNE's functionality easier, and without going through the hassle of creating a new plugin entirely
  - The new system also allows issues in individual modules to be fixed without updating the main TNE plugin itself
- Configurations
  - Reordered some of the currency configurations
  - Changed some of the default configurations based on user feedback.
- Currency
  - Added ability for server owners to change the weight of the minor currency
  - Added ability to separate the major value every three numeric places 
    - The character used to separate is configurable per currency.
  - Revamped currency tiers from being fixed(Major, and Minor) to completely customizable
    - This allows server owners to create currencies that are exactly like real-world counterparts
  - Item-based currencies got major improvements
    - You may now define an item currency by the following:
      - Material Type
      - Damage(this allows for items such as red wool, blue wool, etc to be distinguished from each other)
      - Custom Name
        - Note that player who wish to counterfeit must pay a price.
      - Lore String
      - Enchantment and/or level
      - These new parameters allow for multiple currency tiers to share the same item, but may be distringuished from
      each other be it by a custom name, or another parameter.
  - Added the ability to note money using /note
    - This allows players to withdraw their funds and store it away, or use it for trading.
    - Simply right click with the note in hand to regain funds to balance
  - Added ability to convert currencies that you wish to rename.
- Accounts
  - We now track when the account owner was last online
- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed conversion issues
  - Fixed balance formatting issues players were having when multiworld was disabled
