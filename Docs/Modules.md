# Modules
TNE uses a module-based system to provide extra features. Certain "extras" are provided in the TNE core to give modules certain helper classes, such as item names, vaults, and banks.


## Mobs
The mobs module provides a mob reward system, which allows you to reward players for killing mobs, and/or players.

### Permission Nodes

## Credits
The credits module provides a system for charging for inventory, and command usage.
